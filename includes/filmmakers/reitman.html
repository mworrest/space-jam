Other recent producing endeavors include "Commandments," starring Aidan Quinn and Counrtney Cox; and "Private Parts," starring Howard Stern.<br/>

        "Spellbound," which Reitman produced for the live stage, evolved into the Broadway hit "The Magic Show," starring Doug Henning. He continued producing for the stage with the Off-Broadway hit "The National Lampoon Show," and returned to Broadway to produce and direct the musical "Merlin," earning a Tony nomination for directing.
