                <h3>About the Story...</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Production Photo Bugs Bunny has gotten himself and his Looney Tunes cohorts into a jam by facing off against
                        the Nerdlucks, a grouchy gang of tiny space creatures who land on Earth. The Nerdlucks, dispatched by
                        their boss, the ruthless, belligerent Swackhammer (voice by DANNY DeVITO), intend to kidnap and export
                        the Looney Tunes to Moron Mountain, Swackhammer's failing theme park on the Nerdlucks' boring planet.
                        <br> Bugs has challenged the small, weak aliens to a fateful basketball tournament: if the Looney Tunes win,
                        they'll remain on Earth. But if the aliens win, Bugs and company are headed into the hands of Swackhammer.
                        Their lives won't be worth a single cel...
                        <br> Production Photo The aliens quickly take up Bugs' challenge -- too quickly, it turns out. Bugs hasn't
                        found out yet about the Nerdlucks' ability to instantly "absorb" new skills -- an ability that lets them
                        siphon basketball talent from the likes of NBA stars CHARLES BARKLEY, PATRICK EWING, MUGGSEY BOGUES,
                        LARRY JOHNSON and SHAWN BRADLEY, turning the Nerdlucks into the powerful, speedy, unprincipled and monstrously
                        gifted Monstars!
                        <br> When Bugs does discover what he's up against, he knows he needs some serious help. But where can he
                        go? Basketball's best players are all having their skills "absorbed" by the aliens.
                        <br> Of course, there's a baseball player he happens to know...
                        <br> Production Photo Basketball's most spectacular star, Michael Jordan, has retired from the sport and
                        begun to play baseball -- with limited success. But after the Looney Tunes capture Jordan from a golf
                        course, transport him to Looney Tunes Land and explain, in true Looney Tunes style, their predicament,
                        he agrees to join their team. (Of course, what else can he do? They won't let him go home!)
                        <br> Jordan has taken on a monumental task, however. Yosemite Sam is shooting up the place, Taz can't take
                        ANY kind of direction, Wile E. Coyote is still after the Roadrunner, and chaos rules everything from
                        the free-throw lane to the locker room. Jordan's nearly in despair -- until he meets the newest Looney
                        Tune to join the Tune Squad -- the gorgeous Lola Bunny, a slam-dunkin' team asset and "the rabbit of
                        my dreams" to the love-struck Bugs.
                        <br> Can the motley crew of Michael Jordan and the Tune Squad fight off the Monstars on the court and ensure
                        their futures on planet Earth? Could this be the true story of how Michael Jordan returned to basketball?
                        Don't say no until you've seen "Space Jam"...from the land of comic imagination, where anything is possible!

                <h3>About the Production...</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>It's probably fair to say that no group of animated characters is a more natural fit with an antic sports
                        adventure than the legendary Looney Tunes. Arguably the most popular gang of cartoon personalities in
                        history, the Looney Tunes have been known for more than half a century for their manic energy, eccentric
                        individualism and inspired comedy.
                        <br> David Falk, Michael Jordan's personal attorney and business manager, and Ken Ross, Falk's production
                        partner, approached Warner Bros. with the idea of creating a feature film combining Michael Jordan and
                        the Looney Tunes characters. Warner Bros. was very receptive, since they had been searching for some
                        time to find an appropriate full-length vehicle for their "Tunes" franchise.
                        <br> Production Photo With Falk and Ross on board as executive producers, the studio then sought a "creative
                        captain" to whom they could entrust the overall project. Filmmaker Ivan Reitman, who has been responsible
                        for some of recent history's most successful comedies, seemed the ideal choice.
                        <br> Reitman knew the pairing of sports and tunes had tremendous possibilities. When Warner Bros. expressed
                        its desire to at least temporarily bequeath its "family jewels," the Looney Tunes, to Reitman's imagination
                        and expertise, he was pleased and intrigued by the challenge.
                        <br> "The Looney Tunes, with their tradition of irreverence going back to the 1940s, have always been the
                        cartoon characters that were created for adults," says Reitman. "Sure, kids love them, but their humor
                        has always been wilder and hipper than anything else out there, so adults respond to them on a whole
                        other level. I wanted to recapture that tradition with a story made for today's audiences."
                        <br> Say Falk and Ross, "We believe that Michael Jordan transcends the world of sports. He is an international
                        pop-culture icon who has the ability to become a major entertainment personality. 'Space Jam,' which
                        builds on his previous accomplishments and makes the most of his charisma, is an excellent first film
                        project for Michael, especially since he's allied with the Looney Tunes, which gives the entire movie
                        a unique twist."
                        <br> "The comic possibilities here are literally limitless," reflects Reitman. "Since most of the characters
                        in the story are animated, and many of those are not even of this Earth, we can put them into any situation
                        you can think of that's potentially funny. We aren't limited by what they can physically accomplish."
                        <br> Reitman commissioned a script and began to assemble the rest of his filmmaking team, including his producing
                        partners, Joe Medjuck and Daniel Goldberg, and Joe Pytka, an award-winning director and cinematographer
                        known for his ground-breaking work with live action and animation. Within a year, the filmmaking team
                        began production at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.</p>

                <h3>The Jump Ball</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Production Photo Scheduling the shoot was an immediate challenge. For Michael Jordan, it required that filming
                        be structured around the obligations of his basketball season with the Chicago Bulls. For the animators
                        who were creating the Looney Tunes, Monstars and other animated aspects of the movie, it required time
                        to create the animated characters to complement the already-photographed live-action actors.
                        <br> Under the auspices of Warner Bros.' new Feature Animation division, animation producer Ron Tippe, animation
                        co-directors Bruce Smith and Tony Cervone, scores of animation artists and technicians, Ed Jones and
                        such visual-effects wizards at Cinesite as production VP Mitzi Gallagher and digital-effects supervisors
                        Carlos Arguello and Doug Tubach, quickly got to work.
                        <br> Explains Tippe, "Everyone knows the Looney Tunes, but we wanted 'Space Jam' audiences to see the Looney
                        Tunes as they've never seen them before. There are animation effects in this movie that have never even
                        been attempted on screen in previous movies. We're combining two- and three-dimensional animation with
                        CGI (computer-generated imagery) in a digital setting, all of which is tech-talk for saying the look,
                        the effects, and the blending of the real and the fanciful are truly state-of-the-art."
                        <br> After the computer manipulation is completed, the image is returned to film using red, green and blue
                        lasers, which capture the final picture with no degradation of image, giving the clearest possible look
                        to the finished product. The fiber-optic network used by Cinesite to transmit and receive animation information
                        between the U.S. and London is the world's fastest, exceeding the speed of those used by government agencies
                        and defense contractors.
                        <br> Confirms Bruce Smith, "This was truly a worldwide effort and a tribute to the existing technology that
                        we could all stay in such close communication. Every single shot in the animated portion of this movie
                        had to go through a multitude of steps to take it from the beginning to the end of the process. This
                        includes the creation of the storyboard, where the action is drawn, much like a rough comic strip".
                        <br> Their challenge was to maintain the integrity and appeal of the classic Looney Tunes in a new setting
                        while bringing this cutting-edge technical dazzle to the film. They also had to create a whole spectrum
                        of new characters, from the athletic, curvaceous Lola Bunny and the irascible, volatile Swackhammer,
                        to the tiny Nerdlucks and their towering alter-egos, the Monstars. And all of these celluloid denizens
                        had to interact seamlessly with their flesh-and-blood co-stars.
                        <br> While animation was responding to that challenge, Reitman and Pytka were bringing the live-action portion
                        of the script to life. Stage 22 at Warner Bros. was converted by Cinesite into a huge "green screen"
                        set on which Jordan staged his basketball heroics. There, against walls marked with a graphic grid to
                        help pinpoint future character positions, Jordan played basketball, both with his Looney Tunes teammates
                        and against the animated alien invaders, the larger-than-life Monstars.
                        <br> Production Photo Two-thirds of the 60-day production schedule took place on this stage, during which
                        time Jordan, cameo star BILL MURRAY and Wayne Knight were the only "live" actors on the set. In order
                        to keep the ball in motion and orient the stars' eye contact and responses, the Looney Tunes' and the
                        Monstars' positions were played by actors clothed from head to toe in green suits, rendering them invisible
                        when the film was composited.
                        <br> The presence on the set of animators and members of Cinesite's visual-effects team, working alongside
                        the live-action crew during every second of filming afforded the filmmakers a remarkable amount of on-the-spot
                        information. At any given time, director Joe Pytka could have a frame of film produced by a thermal printer
                        and have an on-set animator draw in the appropriate Looney Tune or Monstar. Through this process, the
                        filmmakers were able to see, months in advance, a rough idea of what the scene would look like -- Michael
                        Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Monstars and all.
                        <br> In addition to their on-site work, the animation staff, under co-directors Bruce Smith and Tony Cervone
                        and animation art director Bill Perkins, were fine-tuning the look of their characters, from the classic
                        figures to the newest additions.
                        <br> Says Cervone, "There are many versions of the best-known animated characters; if you look at Bugs over
                        the years, you can see that he's evolved many times before becoming the figure we recognize today. We
                        worked very closely with Ivan Reitman to establish the appearance of each Looney Tunes character with
                        the look that we all felt was most appropriate for the movie."
                        <br> Adds Smith, "The new characters needed to contrast with the Looney Tunes, but to reflect enough of the
                        same style so that they seem to belong in the same movie. And of course, Lola Bunny was a special case,
                        since she needs to fit perfectly into the Looney Tunes group while playing a very modern bunny of the
                        '90s."
                        <br> Art director Perkins also consulted closely with producer Reitman on the color schemes and palette of
                        "Space Jam," explaining, "It's easy to set a mood with color, especially in animation. I needed to be
                        sure that we conveyed exactly the mood that Ivan, Joe and the other filmmakers thought was right for
                        each sequence. That means the color, the architecture, the furnishings, the props -- everything that
                        a live-action scene uses to establish itself, we had to create from our imaginations and draw. It gave
                        us the freedom to inject humor into many things, simply by drawing, shading and coloring them the right
                        way."
                        <br> Production Photo Off-stage locations for the live-action sequences included Blair Field in Long Beach,
                        for scenes recreating Jordan's season with the Birmingham Barons baseball team; and the beautiful Lake
                        Arrowhead Country Club, where Jordan and his publicist, Stan, play a round of golf with friends Bill
                        Murray and LARRY BIRD before Michael is "sucked" into Looney Tune land by his pal Bugs.

                        Garden in New York. During filming at the Arena, no fewer than 20 current and past NBA stars took part
                        in the live-action/animated basketball scenes.
                        <br> A residential neighborhood in Pasadena served as the exterior of the Jordan residence. Additional interior

                        the United Kingdom worked for approximately 12 additional months, incorporating computer-generated imagery
                        (CGI), traditional cel animation, digital animation techniques and special effects, to create a high-energy,
                        high-resolution rendering of the animated world of the Looney Tunes.
                        <br> Weekly meetings at Reitman's production company included screenings of in-progress film and viewing
                        of animation and storyboards. Reitman worked tirelessly to make sure that "Space Jam" would be a visual
                        and comedic groundbreaker.
                        <br> Under his supervision, and that of Medjuck, Goldberg, Ron Tippe, Bruce Smith and Tony Cervone, Warner
                        Bros. animators and artists in as many as 10 affiliated studios began drawing and animating the characters
                        in each scene. This was done in the traditional manner, with pencil and paper, in both the London and
                        California headquarters of the "Space Jam" animation crews.
                        <br> Says Tippe, "Our California and London studios communicated many times a day by computer. We also quickly
                        established close communication with our partners, including Uli Meyer Features Ltd., Stardust Pictures
                        in London; Character Builders, Inc. in Ohio; Spaff Animation in California, Charles Gammage Animation,
                        Inc. in Canada; and several others. The logistics of completing this project were considerable.
                        <br> "Hand-drawn layouts were created, cleaned up and then turned over to background artists, who hand-painted
                        them into background paintings. Rough animation followed the layout phase and was, in turn, followed
                        by assistant animation, where the characters were cleaned up; and effects animation, where shadows, tones,
                        highlights, props and other non-character elements were animated. The character and effects levels were
                        then scanned and painted digitally."
                        <br> Among the key participants in this process were co-producer ALISON ABATE, who oversaw the animation
                        process and scheduling; visual effects producer HELEN ELSWIT, who served as the link between the "Space
                        Jam" production team and Cinesite; and art director Bill Perkins.
                        <br> Explains Perkins, "We created two color universes for the story: primary colors for the Looney Tunes,
                        which are their traditional settings, and secondary colors for the Monstars and the Moron Mountain amusement
                        park. All in all, we created between 300 and 400 backgrounds for this movie."
                        <br> After the animation was complete, the footage was sent via high-speed telecommunications systems to
                        Cinesite, a post-production and special-effects subsidiary of Eastman Kodak, for digitally compositing
                        the animation and live-action components and the creation of the computer-generated three-dimensional
                        visual "environments."
                        <br> The animated sequences were digitally scanned and loaded into the Cineon compositing system at Cinesite.
                        There, the images could be composited with live footage previously loaded, to create seamless integration
                        of animated and human characters.
                        <br> Explains Ed Jones,preisdent and founder of Cinesite, "Since all of the footage was transformed into
                        digital information, there was no loss of clarity when several "layers" of animation were added to a
                        live scene or combined with visual effects. This is a giant step forward in making sophisticated animation
                        possible."
                        <br> Jones adds, "Warner Bros. gave us characters with plenty of visual comic potential, and the filmmakers'
                        live-action story was played broadly enough to inspire lots of visual humor. It was our job to use the
                        latest in digital technology to make the most of the opportunities we were given."
                        <br> The Nerdlucks' space ship, for example, was created in 3-D, based on a painting created by Warner Bros.
                        Feature Animation and built on a computer using CGI (computer-generated imagery), then dropped into an
                        existing frame of "real-life' scenery. Next, the "atmospheric effects," such as shading, dust swirls,
                        texture and other visual fine tuning were created using 2-D and 3-D digital computer effects.
                        <br> Production PhotoA scene in which hapless publicist Stan is inflated by the Looney Tunes began with computer
                        cyberscanning of Wayne Knight's face. The scanner translates analog information into digital information
                        that the computer can read, allowing artists to build a 3-D model from the results. A 3-D computer-generated
                        body was added, then 2-D atmosphere was applied. Then the 3-D computer face, head and body were modified
                        on the screen to inflate, and the result was dropped into a scene combining digitally created background
                        and a 2-D animated setting.
                        <br> "We're using so many new techniques here that the final technology on this movie makes the stuff we
                        did at the start of the production obsolete," comments Jones.
                        <br> The crowd at the basketball tournament was a combination of traditionall animated characters, 3-D animated
                        characters and a crowd of actual people wearing masks. It was computer scanned and then tone and lighting
                        were manipulated to create a "semi-animated" look that bridged the two worlds of live action and animation.
                        The court scene consists of a CGI floor; 2-dimensional chairs; digitalized computer shading and "environment,"
                        including smoke, haze and light; a live-action crowd; and a real ball and net, all combined into a single
                        image on the screen.
                        <br> Reitman and his filmmaking team met with the Feature Animation and Cinesite crews weekly for review
                        of the completed footage. "It wasn't enough for the scenes to be technically perfect," asserts Reitman.
                        "They had to further the action without distracting people from the story and, most important, they had
                        to be entertaining, funny and true to the characters."</p>

                <h3>Voices, Please</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Even before animation began, voice artists were busily recording their dialogue. rather than exclusively
                        employing traditional voice-over actors, Reitman sought a wide range of talented performers. In particular,
                        actors with comedic and improvisational skills were cast to create energetic, funny characterizations
                        that lived up to the standards set by the legendary Mel Blanc.
                        <br> BILLY WEST provided the voice of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, and DEE BRADLEY BAKER voiced Daffy Duck,
                        the Tazmanian Devil and Bull. BOB BERGEN created the voices of Bertie, Hubie, Marvin the Martian, Porky
                        Pig, Speedy Gonzales and Tweety. Sylvester, Yosemite Sam and Foghorn Leghorn were voiced by BILL FARMER,
                        and KATH SOUCIE provided the voice of the newly created LOLA BUNNY.
                        <br> Actor Danny DeVito, who usually performs in front of the camera as an actor, or steps behind it as a
                        producer-director, added another title to his repertoire when he took on the role of the bombastic, sadistic
                        Swackhammer. He recorded his role early in the filming process and was soon followed by numerous voiceover
                        specialists who appeared to supply the voices of the remaining characters.
                        <br> "We've really enjoyed blending the classic humor of the Looney Tunes with Michael Jordan's boundless
                        charm and energy, and the latest advances in technological achievement," concludes Ivan Reitman. "This
                        movie has been a mix of the old and new that I think is going to add to the ageless appeal of animation
                        as entertainment."
                        <br> Warner Bros. Presents an Ivan Reitman//David Falk/Ken Ross Production: Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny

            <h1>Technical Notes</h1>
                <p>By Bill Warren</p>
                <h3>The Technical Background to Space Jam</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Ivan Reitman is known as the director of such hit comedies as Twins, Stripes and Dave, but in his busy career,
                        he has returned again and again to technically challenging projects. He produced They Came from Within,
                        the first David Cronenberg movie to get wide release; it involved creepy parasites. Reitman also produced
                        Heavy Metal, one of the first feature cartoons aimed primarily at adult audiences. And, of course, there
                        was Ghostbusters and its sequel, the worldwide hits that he both produced and directed--and which opened
                        many doors to new kinds of special effects.
                        <br> Daffy and Michael So it's hardly surprising that Reitman has now produced Warner Bros.' first release
                        through its new Feature Animation division: Space Jam, directed by Joe Pytka. It is also the first feature
                        film in history to combine such a large amount of traditional cartoon animation, live action and three-dimensional
                        computer graphics. Space Jam stars sports superstar Michael Jordan as well as Bugs Bunny, the Looney
                        Tunes, Wayne Knight, Theresa Randle. Cameos are played by Bill Murray, former Boston Celtics great Larry
                        Bird, and NBA stars Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkely, Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson and Shawn Bradley. Reitman's
                        long-time associates, Joe Medjuck and Dan Goldberg, produce with him.
                        <br> The animation segments, produced through Warner Bros Feature Animation, are co-directed by Bruce Smith
                        and Tony Cervone, and the animation producer is Ron Tippe. The post-production and computer visual effects
                        were created by Cinesite, a Hollywood facility specializing in digital dazzle and sophisticated effects,
                        whose founder, Ed Jones, received an Academy Award for his work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
                        <br> So what does this exotic hybrid of computers, artists and actors require from the filmmakers and their
                        crews?
                        <br> When moviegoers think of "computer animation," they are most likely without a clear idea of what that
                        term really means. Many may assume that a computer scientist sits in front of a console, types in the
                        words "Bugs Bunny" and "Daffy Duck," chooses plot option C-27, and the setting "Mars." He presses "enter"
                        and goes out for a cup of coffee. He comes back an hour later to find a seven-minute cartoon sticking
                        out of the side of the computer.
                        <br> Well, that's not all, folks. That's not even close, folks--for the artist is never out of the loop.
                        As computer-intensive as it is, even Space Jam began with talented animators drawing some of the most
                        famous cartoon characters in the world in the usual way: with pencil on paper. What happens after that
                        is the technical story behind Space Jam.</p>
                </article>
                <h3>Putting Real Life Into the Cartoon World</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Combining live human performers with cartoon characters goes back to almost the very birth of cartoons. In
                        1906, J. Stuart Blackton's Humorous Phases of Funny Faces featured a live cartoonist creating moving
                        drawings on a blackboard. At the climax of Winsor McKay's famous Gertie the Dinosaur (1909), the delightful
                        Gertie picks up her human creator and carries him off. Walt Disney began his career with a series of
                        shorts in which a little girl named Alice--a live entertainer, shot on standard film--frolicked with
                        cartoon animals.
                        <br> Over the years, there were other brief attempts at combining live action and cartoons; Disney returned
                        to it with Song of the South in 1949. At Warner Bros. the same year, in My Dream is Yours, Doris Day
                        and Jack Carson scampered through a little boy's dream, performing with the Oscar-winning rabbit, Bugs
                        Bunny. At MGM, Gene Kelly and Esther Williams performed with that studio's most famous characters, Tom
                        & Jerry--Kelly in Anchors Aweigh (1945), Williams in Dangerous When Wet (1953). And back at Disney, the
                        1964 hit, Mary Poppins, sent Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke on a jolly holiday with animated penguins
                        and street entertainers.
                        <br> Although those sequences were spectacular and entertaining, it wasn't until the Amblin/Disney production
                        of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? in 1988 that anyone tried to combine animated characters and live-action
                        actors throughout a feature-length movie.
                        <br> As dazzling and technically sophisticated as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? certainly was, that was then and
                        this is now. As Tony Cervone puts it, "Roger Rabbit was the vinyl LP and this is the compact disc." Space
                        Jam has leapfrogged ahead in the realm of combining live action and cartoons, by tapping the talents
                        of Roger Rabbit innovator Ed Jones and other gifted effects and animation experts.
                        <br> Wendy Aylsworth, Vice President of Technology and Facilities for Warner Bros. Feature Animation, points
                        out the differences. "Everything in Roger Rabbit was shot to film, then the pieces of film were combined.
                        But with today's technology, we can now have all of the animation colored in the computer; the original
                        live-action footage is also scanned into the computer, and of course the three-dimensional aspects are
                        created in the computer. So all of the individual elements for Space Jam can come together in the computer;
                        each individual element can be modified in color and brightness and lighting and texture to make it all
                        mesh seamlessly."
                        <br> As Tony Cervone says, "I don't think any picture has combined so many different media as Space Jam has."
                        Bruce Smith adds, "And all are interchangeable at different times, so it's not one medium with another
                        constantly. There's animation with the CG [computer graphics] environment, it's animation in the traditional
                        environment, it's live action in the CG environment, and live action with the animated environment."</p>
                </article>
                <h3>Technology Shapes Art</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Almost all the advances seen on the screen are due to the amazingly rapid progress in the application of
                        computers to the field of animation--in fact, to virtually every aspect of Space Jam. Early in the film,
                        after we've met Michael Jordan, the camera pans upward and the standard live-action world is left behind
                        as we see a miniature rooftop; the camera moves higher to a computer-created sky and the Nerdlucks' home
                        planet.
                        <br> Moving closer to this "3-D" world, the camera passes into a giant carved mouth and ends on a scene of
                        classic cartoon (or "2-D") animation. In what looks like one unbroken camera movement, we move from the
                        realm of reality to miniatures to computer graphics and finally to cartoon animation. (The use of the
                        term "3-D" here differs from the old 3-D used in Warner Bros.' classic House of Wax: audiences won't
                        dodge basketballs flying off the screen. Here, it means simply the realm of computer graphics which have
                        a more solid, dimensional look than flat, "2-D" cartoon animation.)
                        <br> Movies run at 24 frames per second, but most cartoon features are shot "on twos," meaning that one drawing
                        is repeated for two frames. Therefore, there are 12 individual drawings for each second in the usual
                        Hollywood cartoon.
                        <br> However, it's true that in any feature, a lot of the animation is shot "on ones" -- 24 new drawings
                        per second, just like the number of frames used to film live action. This is usually done for fast action
                        or other moments where fluidity and clarity of action are important, or, as with Space Jam, when cartoons
                        and live actors appear together and must coordinate their motion,reactions and postions. On Space Jam,
                        all of this animation was done by hand by the animators of the film.
                        <br> In addition to the state-of-the-art computers and animation techniques, other cutting-edge technology
                        was used in "Space Jam." Most movies that blend effects into footage shot with a moving camera use variations
                        on the "motion control" system originally developed for Star Wars. A computer is attached to the camera
                        so that it can remember the precise moves the camera made, and can reproduce them when the effects team
                        adds other elements to the scene. Or a camera computer can "encode" the movements of the camera even
                        if it is being moved by a human operator.
                        <br> Says director Joe Pytka, "We used the best equipment, as well as the best ideas we could come up with,
                        to make Space Jam a movie worth watching. As technology continues to evolve, audiences know what to watch

                <h3>Being Green</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>One of the problems in filming actors working with cartoon characters who are added later is that it's very
                        hard for anyone to visually focus on an empty space three feet in front of them that will later be filled
                        with a talking duck. Try it yourself: it's nearly impossible. The result is that the human beings rarely
                        seem to be looking directly at the cartoon characters. Even if audiences don't notice this consciously,
                        it's a kind of unconscious static that interferes with the belief that all this is really happening.
                        <br> Reitman, director Joe Pytka and Ed Jones, the founder and head of Cinesite, came up with an ingenious
                        solution to this problem--and their solution solves several other problems as well. It involves the use
                        of a lot of green walls, green floors, and actors from the Groundlings improvisation comedy troupe covered
                        all but for their eyes in clothing of the same green color. In fact, if you'd been on the set of Space
                        Jam, you'd have seen the nearly surreal sight of Michael Jordan vigorously playing basketball in a green
                        gym with a bunch of green people, some of whom scamper about in crouched-over positions. Other than Jordan
                        himself, the only colors you could see other than green would have been the basketball net and its backboard--and
                        regularly-spaced red balls and dots in a square grid all over the floors and walls. But that's not what
                        you'll see in the finished film.
                        <br> Joe Pytka loves strong, forceful camera moves; Michael Jordan is, of course, an athlete who expresses
                        himself best through movement--and it can rarely be rehearsed in the way an acting performance is. As
                        Ed Jones says, "We had to shoot Michael being inventive, and Michael's only inventive one time--the camera
                        had better be ready to capture it." Spontaneity was the rule of the day, but cartoons, by their very
                        nature, are, of course, totally controlled by the artists. The challenge was to combine Pytka's needs
                        and Jordan's abilities with the cartoons. The solution was that green room and those red dots</p>

                <h3>To Sherman Oaks -- and Beyond</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Because of the complex nature and relatively short production schedule of Space Jam, in addition to the team at the Warner
                        Bros. Feature Animation facility in Sherman Oaks and the team in the company's London studio, the production
                        recruited a select group of animation studios all over the world. Ultimately, everything was sent to
                        Space Jam's Sherman Oaks headquarters, where all the drawings were scanned into computers and digitally
                        transmitted, via fiber-optic cables, to Cinesite's computers for compositing.
                        <br> The involvement of computers on Space Jam began immediately after the animators completed their drawings,
                        and the background painters their work. These were scanned into digital computer memory by using Cambridge
                        Animation's powerful and versatile Animo software program, used to complete the next several stages of
                        work.
                        <br> Michael with Tune SquadThe ink and paint department no longer uses real ink and real paint; instead,
                        using the Animo program, they call up the animators' drawings, one frame at a time, onto a computer screen.
                        The expressive pencil lines of the animators are temporarily replaced by very thin lines the computer
                        creates--it even completes lines when the artist has, for purposes of delineation, left them broken.
                        <br> Using color models created by art director Bill Perkins and his staff, the "painter" employs Animo's
                        built-in palette to color each of the animated characters on the computer screen in flat, bright colors,
                        much like a standard seven-minute cartoon. For the classic Looney Tunes gang, this was, of course, the
                        colors established over years of use; for the Nerdlucks, Monstars and Swackhammer, the colors are, of
                        course, new.
                        <br> One of the most interesting features of Animo is that it allows the colors to be changed at will. Once
                        a sequence is fully colored, if the directors or art director want the characters changed, this can be
                        done with a few strokes on the keyboard. For example, if a scene originally colored for daylight becomes
                        a nighttime scene instead, they can replace all of the bright colors with darker tones.
                        <br> Animation producer Ron Tippe points out the advantages. "If you compare the traditional ink-and-paint
                        process of Xeroxing the artwork onto cels and painting it by hand, there's a great savings in time. With
                        original cel paint, very often only one or two colors at a time could be painted. You would then have
                        to wait for those colors to dry, and then repaint it, so it was a very exhausting process." Wendy Aylsworth
                        adds, "We're averaging about 4 minutes for every cel that's painted. Traditionally, if you hand-painted
                        that stuff on acetate, it's more like 20 to 30 minutes per cel."
                        <br> When all the coloring is done, the original pencil lines are restored; the flow, the thickness, the
                        manipulation of the line that often adds so much to an animated character is back where it should be.
                        If these lines need their own color changed, from the gray of pencil to, say, bold red for a dramatic
                        effect, this can be done as well, without ever losing the characteristics of the animators' original
                        drawings. With traditional animation, the color had to be scraped off each individual cel.
                        <br> These technical innovations give shape and life to the Looney Tunes characters, but of course, there's
                        more to Space Jam than a class reunion of Bugs, Daffy and their pals. There are live actors in the animated
                        world, and animated characters in the real world.
                        <br> Because so much of Space Jam takes place in the "real world," the drawings needed a further boost than
                        is given in most cartoons: they needed to look as though they were being lit by movie lights. The "key
                        light," the strongest light in a scene, was represented by highlighting the parts of the cartoon character
                        illuminated most strongly by this light. "Fill lights," the dimmer lights in a scene, also needed to
                        be indicated, as did the areas of the characters not being "struck" by light.
                        <br> The "tone mattes" that create this were the work of effects animators. Bill Perkins explains, "They
                        create hard-edged black pieces of artwork that define the lighter or darker areas on the character. The
                        black region dictates at a later stage of compositing what kind of color is added to or taken out of
                        that area of the character to make it appear rounded. So you'll have a piece of black matte artwork that
                        defines the brighter areas where light is striking a character, and you'll have another that defines
                        the darker area, where it's more in shade." The mattes themselves look like thick-lined, negative images
                        of the animated characters with some parts left out.
                        <br> "Each animated character," Wendy Aylsworth explains, "has multiple mattes drawn over it to give it shadings."
                        The mattes were scanned into the Animo system, exactly like the original animation, then laid over the
                        colored animation artwork to indicate the lightening and darkening of the colors of the individual characters

                <h3>On to Cinesite</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>When all this work was done--entirely within the digital computer realm--it was transmitted over a high speed
                        network connection from the Space Jam offices in Sherman Oaks to the offices of Cinesite, the computer
                        visual-effects and post-production company, in Hollywood.
                        <br> Here, using Kodak's Cineon system, artists worked on the drawings even further with compositing computers.
                        Digital effects producer Helen Elswit explains, "We set up a 'hero shot'--in each scene, a specific shot
                        is chosen so that the art director, Bill Perkins, and I can sit down with the main compositor at the
                        computer and set the look for the scene. For the most part, unless there is a dramatic mood or lighting
                        change in a scene, one hero shot is sufficient. This shot is then put out on film so that Ivan Reitman
                        can give his approval. Once we have that hero established, Cinesite joins the process, taking the hero
                        shot and all the other shots from animation in that sequence, and builds the scene."
                        <br> Michael and BugsCinesite vice president of production Mitzi Gallagher explains, "We found that as we
                        began adding live-action and animated characters to a scene, the initial look needed to be adjusted to
                        make sure that the right characters were emphasized with no one blending into the background. Our digital-effects
                        supervisors, Carlos Arguello and Doug Tubach, adjusted the brightness, the colors, the tones and shadows,
                        working with Ivan Reitman so that all the various elements were consistent and accomplished the scene
                        the way he envisioned it throughout the scene."
                        <br> Cinesite went further, too. They added depth to the backgrounds--buildings "moved" further away, trees
                        came closer, for example. What would be called "grad filters" with a real camera were also employed,
                        allowing a given shot to be darkened subtly around the edges, so that the viewer's eye will focus on
                        the highlighted center of the shot. And they could manipulate the tone mattes further as well, creating
                        as many different layers of shading as desired.
                        <br> "We break the tone mattes down into separate elements," Ed Jones explains, "depending on whether they're
                        on a cheek or on a body. We can control the density, the color, the amount of blur on the edge, depending
                        on how we want to light the character. We are painting on film with the computer and we're creating dimensionality,
                        depending on whether the character is closer to the camera or farther away. The closer it is to the camera,
                        the more it must be modeled. And then we can add motion blur, like a camera shutter would blur a regular
                        scene. We can stylize how each of these animated characters looks."
                        <br> In traditional animation, these different layers represented by the flat art, the backgrounds and the
                        tone mattes, were literally that: layers of celluloid with paint on them. Going beyond five or six layers
                        tended to bring out the faint color of the celluloid itself, adding a yellowish, cloudy look to the more
                        layered sequences. The famous "multiplane" of the Disney studios, which used sheets of glass stacked
                        like a colossal sandwich, was an effort to overcome some of these problems, but it is a huge, cumbersome
                        device used only for the most spectacular scenes requiring many layers of depth.
                        <br> By keeping all of the drawings in digital form (but easily shown on a video screen), the Cineon operator
                        can add as many layers of depth as the scene needs without any loss of definition or addition of unwanted
                        color whatsoever. Tony Cervone adds, "You could put ten thousand layers on this stuff, and it will do
                        nothing, it will never cloud up."
                        <br> Furthermore, with all the animation now loaded into the computers, the kind of small errors that can
                        creep in with so many people working on a project can easily be corrected. "Sometimes," says Wendy Aylsworth,
                        "when we've got the shots together, the perspective doesn't look right, or the sizing is off because
                        something went wrong in doing the rotoscopes (drawings based on moving images). Or perhaps a character
                        was drawn too close, but should be further into the background. You can use the computer to completely
                        re-size and reposition any character, to make them fit into the scene correctly. The computer is used
                        a lot for that, making sure everything's staying in perspective."</p>

                <h3>On the Basketball Court</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>One problem that has always existed with cartoons is the sometimes wildly shifting perspectives of a background.
                        If you are using a movie or video camera, panning over any background behind the actors, if you examined
                        the film a frame at a time, you'd see that the background seems to distort a little--or a lot, if a wide-angle
                        lens is used.
                        <br> In conventional cartoons, this distortion has to be drawn in by hand on the backgrounds. For example,
                        if the scene required a swift pan down a drainpipe on the corner of a building, the artist had to draw
                        a radically distorted drainpipe: straw-thin at the top of the drawing, expanding to a big bulge in the
                        middle, tapering away to nothing again at the bottom. The camera, moving in a flat plane down this artwork,
                        appeared to do a whip-pan down the side of the building. And don't forget the building: that, too, would
                        have to be carefully drawn in a distorted way to match the drainpipe.
                        <br> Sylvester and GrannyIt takes the talents of both an artist and a mathematician to create this kind of
                        distortion, and it takes a lot of time. Space Jam, surprisingly enough, went from conception to finished
                        product in one-third the time of a normal animated feature-and yet it required more amazing shifts in
                        perspective than a normal animated feature.
                        <br> Originally, the giant basketball stadium at the end was going to be raised up above the basketball court,
                        in an effort to overcome some of these perspective problems, as well as to evade having to animate all
                        the spectators. But Ivan Reitman and Joe Pytka bit the bullet: in a real NBA stadium, the seats come
                        right down to a few feet of the basketball court, so the stadium in Space Jam required the same kind
                        of seating. These perspectives were going to have to shift, and there were going to be thousands of animated
                        spectators.
                        <br> Cinesite found the solutions to these problems, as well as how to incorporate Pytka's swirling camera
                        moves. The first big basketball scene in Space Jam is set in a practice gym, where Michael Jordan learns
                        just how inept the Looney Tunes characters are when it comes to dribbling and slam-dunking. The walls
                        and floors of the gym are entirely created within the computer; all Michael Jordan saw was that sea of
                        green, and guys in green suits.
                        <br> Animation layout artists designed the practice gym and designers at Cinesite created a computer model
                        of that gym, first in what's known as a "wire frame." This simply means that what you'd see on the computer
                        screen is the gym as if it were made of thin white wires only, stark against a black background.
                        <br> Meanwhile, the scenes of Michael Jordan and the green Groundlings in the green court were digitized,
                        and all the green dropped out, which took away everything except Michael Jordan, the basketball, and
                        the hoop, net and backboard. He seemed to be playing basketball against invisible opponents in a black
                        limbo.
                        <br> But don't forget those red dots: they were uniformly spaced around the room in a four-foot grid. Much
                        as graph paper is used to plot curves, the computer could remember precisely the location of each of
                        those balls. When this information was applied to the 3-D wire frame of the practice gym, the computer
                        could move the wire frame about in "virtual space" in ways that precisely matched the live camera of
                        director Joe Pytka. The moves of the camera drove the movements of the gym itself.
                        <br> This was added to the footage of Michael Jordan--all in digital space, maintaining perfect resolution--and
                        he seemed to be playing basketball now in a gym made of white lines on a black background. Now this footage
                        was printed a frame at a time onto "photo rotos" and sent back to the animators in Sherman Oaks. They
                        could see Michael Jordan's precise location, and where the green Groundlings were; they could then place
                        the animated characters exactly where they needed to be, a frame at a time. The animators didn't have
                        to follow the movements of the green Groundlings exactly, because even a crouching real live person doesn't
                        have the same dimensions as Daffy Duck.
                        <br> The process described above was again applied, this time to the footage of Michael Jordan and the Looney
                        Tunes characters working out in the practice gym--playing basketball. The ball is real when Michael Jordan
                        is touching it, but had to be put into some form of animation when Bugs and his buddies control it. However,
                        no matter what form it's in, it's no ordinary ball, and here's why:
                        <br> Joe Pytka is a major basketball fan; one of his most treasured possessions is a scuffed old ball that
                        has been touched by many of the greatest basketball players who ever lived. Ed Jones and his crew managed
                        to sneak the ball away from Pytka, and scanned it from every possible angle into the computer.
                        <br> Now in computer-graphics form, the ball could be animated to do anything they wanted, so that whenever
                        Jordan is holding the ball, or it's bouncing off the rim or swishing through the net, it's real. When
                        Elmer Fudd dribbles it down the court and passes it to Yosemite Sam, it's computer animation of Pytka's
                        beloved ball.
                        <br> That ball bounces about on the court of a giant stadium, rendered in "3-D" computer graphics. Ed Jones
                        and the team at Cinesite did everything they could to make the stadium look as real as possible: the
                        floor has a polished sheen, the overhead lights occasionally make (computer-realized) "lens flares,"
                        and the lighting on the audience is blotchy in the way it is in real life. All this is complex, but these
                        days, is not particularly difficult for talented computer artists to create.</p>

                <h3>Filling the Bleachers</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>What was hard was the audience itself. This sequence takes place in the land beneath the ground where the
                        Looney Tunes characters live, so the audience had to be entirely cartoon characters--twenty-five thousand
                        of them. While Bill Perkins and others at Warner Bros.' Sherman Oaks studio could provide Cinesite with
                        strips of Looney Tunes characters, animating so many characters was, flatly, impossible.
                        <br> They overcame the problem with startling ingenuity. First, Cinesite simply duplicated some of those
                        characters in their computers and scattered about the auditorium; their coloration could be changed,
                        but there were still limitations in doing it this way: an entire squad of, say, kilt-wearing Scotsmen
                        (one of Bugs' old opponents) would certainly not go unnoticed, even if some of them wore paisley kilts.
                        <br> Ed Jones hit upon the idea of filming real people, some in bizarre costumes--there's a guy wearing a
                        spotted cow suit, for example--others in regular clothing that's in bright, primary, cartoon colors.
                        Some of these people wore generic "cartoon" heads, others wore the heads of specific characters. Then
                        these were scanned digitally into the computer, manipulated there in any number of ways: in terms of
                        color, size, whether they're standing and cheering or sitting and applauding, how far they are from the
                        "camera's" position, and so forth. "We've mixed and matched all these characters," Jones explains, "mostly
                        for the front rows. The audience is still going to see the motion in the back rows as they look up there.
                        The crowd is part of the environment."
                        <br> Occasionally, the Sherman Oaks team animated a specific portion of the stands to highlight a cartoon-animated
                        figure (watch for the bull from "Bully for Bugs," for example). By these means, the handful of live-action
                        people and the strips of cartoon animation multiplied over and over until they became a cheering throng
                        of cartoon characters.
                        <br> New technologies are created to solve old problems, but sometimes those new technologies can create
                        problems of their own--and as always, it is up to human ingenuity to solve them. For example, while shooting
                        in the all-green set, occasionally one of the green Groundlings passed briefly in front of, say, Michael
                        Jordan's leg, a quick move that went unnoticed at first. But since the green all went away, that meant
                        that part of Jordan's leg hidden by the green guy also went away. Co-directors of animation Bruce Smith
                        and Tony Cervone went over every day's work in a "sweat box" session, and when they'd spot a bit of Michael
                        disappearing, they knew that it was time to have, say, Sylvester chase Tweety Bird through the scene,
                        hiding that momentary loss of Jordan's body.</p>

                <h3>Distoring Michael Jordan</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>And speaking of Michael Jordan's body, thanks to Cinesite, he gets battered and transformed as much as any
                        of the animated characters. "When Michael is first introduced into looney Tunes Land," Ed Jones explains,
                        "he's playing a golf game, and gets zipped down a hole. We shot two plates [scenes to which effects are
                        added] on location, one of Michael bending over, and one with just the golf green. Michael pantomimed
                        going down the hole, and then we built a 3-D Michael."
                        <br> This wasn't some Frankensteinian experiment, but a matter of scanning Michael and storing his digital
                        image in a computer. This enabled Cinesite to manipulate the footage of Jordan in exactly the same way
                        as any other artwork: Michael could be stretched, squashed, and even wadded up into the shape of a basketball.
                        <br> "We added other magic, too," Jones grins. "When Bugs kisses Michael, we altered Michael's lips a little--stretched
                        them out a little as Bugs' lips come back out. There are times when Bugs is tapping Michael, so we added
                        indentations into Michael's clothing from Bugs' fingers. This is for the laserdisc collector, who can
                        stop on a frame and see all our tricks."
                        <br> Not only does Michael Jordan plunge literally headfirst into the world of the animated Looney Tunes
                        characters, but Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck venture out into the real world to retrieve Michael's basketball
                        and his uniform. Again, green Groundlings were used, but this time they were shot in a realistic set
                        of Michael's office rather than a green background. However, they were dropped out in the same way as
                        though they had been shot on a green stage, and Bugs and Daffy were added where appropriate.
                        <br> At one point, one of the character rummages through a drawer; the team shot this twice, once with the
                        green Groundling going through this action, and once a simple plate of the same set of drawers with no
                        one there. "In that case," digital effects producer Helen Elswit explains, "animation didn't have to
                        cover the green guy. Artists could use it to draw in their animation while having the background fully
                        visible. They were able to remove the green guy and still see what was behind him. Animators could be
                        as free as they wanted, because they didn't have to worry about filling the space left when the green
                        guy was removed on the computer."</p>

                <h3>The Artist is in the System</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>All of the various elements of Space Jam gradually made their way into the computer systems at Cinesite,
                        until the entire film existed there. When it came time to turn it into actual film, the computer was
                        involved as well. With other computer animation systems, a very high resolution monitor is simply photographed
                        by an appropriate camera, but with Cineon, there's no camera involved at all. A system of lasers is used
                        to transfer the computer image directly onto film.
                        <br> One of the classic fears about computers has always been that they would wipe out jobs, making artisans,
                        workers and even artists obsolete. But that's simply not happening. As Bruce Smith says, "I think the
                        computer has always been intended to be an aid to the artist, and not necessarily to replace him. In
                        this instance, we totally manipulated the computer for our use. It frees us up from the highly technical
                        aspects that have to be believable in the way we make films today."
                        <br> Producer Ivan Reitman marvels at the achievements that have brought Space Jam from concept to dazzling
                        reality in such a short time, but he is realistic about the role of technology in creating a motion picture,
                        animated or not. "Technology will never take the place of those creative skills that lead producers,
                        directors and writers to make movies in the first place. A word processor doesn't make a novelist any
                        more than a synthesizer makes a composer.
                        <br> "Despite all the technological advances in animation, the quality of the production is still totally
                        dependent on the skills of the artists. Computers are simply the latest tools available to help them
                        bring their vision to reality. No hardware or software will ever replace human creativity."</p>
