                <p>DANNY DeVITO (voice of Swackhammer) is one of the most diversely successful talents in Hollywood. An award-winning film, stage and television actor, as well as a writer, producer and director who has earned popular and critical acclaim, DeVito pursues a career as busy as it is varied. In addition to his voice work on "Space Jam," will soon be seen in "Hercules," "Mars Attacks!" and "L.A. Confidential." He is currently in production for Francis Ford Coppola in "Rainmaker."

DeVito increased his repertoire and visibility with a starring role in the long-running hit TV series "Taxi," and also starrred in the series "All That Glitters." However, his greatest achievements have been in the world of movies, where his credits include "One Flew Over the Cockoo's Nest," "Terms of Endearment," "Romancing the Stone," the telefilm "The Ratings Game" (which marked his directing debut),"The Jewel of the Nile," "Ruthless People," "Tin Men," "Throw Momma From the Train" (which he also directed), "Twins" (for Ivan Reitman), "The War of the Roses" (which he also directed), "Other People's Money," "Batman Returns," "Hoffa" (which he also produced and directed), "Jack the Bear," "Rennaissance Man," "Junior" (again for Ivan Reitman), "Get Shorty" (which he also produced), "Matilda" (which he also produced and directed) and the upcoming "Hercules," "Mars Attacks!" and "L.A. Confidential."

DeVito is a founding partner in Jersey Films, which has produced "Reality Bites," "Eight Seconds," "Pulp Fiction" (which received the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and seven Academy Award nominations), "Sunset Park" and "Feeling Minnesota," as well as the films noted earlier.

A native of New Jersey, DeVito attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and began his career on stage in 'The Man With the Flower in His Mouth," which was followed by plays including "The Shrinking Bride" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." He was later asked by producer Michael Douglas to re-create his "Cuckoo's Nest" role in the film of the same name, which brought DeVito his first national recognition.</p>
